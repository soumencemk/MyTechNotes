# Software Metrics

Software metrics are quantitative measures that are used to evaluate and improve the software development process. Here are some of the most common software metrics and their meanings:

- __Lines of Code (LOC):__ The number of lines of code in a software program. This metric is often used as a measure of the size and complexity of a program.

- __Cyclomatic Complexity (CC):__ A measure of the complexity of a program based on the number of decision points or branches in the code. Higher CC values indicate more complex code, which may be more difficult to maintain and debug.

- __Code Coverage:__ A measure of how much of the code is exercised by the software test cases. Code coverage is used to assess the quality of the test suite and to identify areas of the code that are not being tested.

- __Defect Density:__ The number of defects per unit of code. This metric is used to assess the quality of the software and to identify areas of the code that require improvement.

- __Function Points:__ A measure of the functionality provided by a software system. Function points are calculated based on the number of inputs, outputs, and transactions in the system.

- __Maintainability Index:__ A measure of the ease with which a software system can be maintained. The maintainability index takes into account factors such as code complexity, code size, and code documentation.

- __Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):__ A measure of the reliability of a software system. MTBF is calculated as the average time between failures of the system.

- __Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):__ A measure of how quickly defects in the software can be repaired. MTTR is calculated as the average time it takes to repair a defect in the system.

- __Memory Usage:__ A measure of the amount of memory used by a software program. Memory usage is important because it can impact the performance of the program and the overall system.

- __Response Time:__ A measure of the time it takes for a software program to respond to a user request. Response time is important for ensuring that the software is responsive and user-friendly.

These metrics can be used to assess the quality and performance of software during development and after release. By tracking these metrics over time, software development teams can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize their processes.


## Non-functional software metrics 

are used to measure the quality attributes of a software system, such as reliability, maintainability, efficiency, usability, and portability. Here are some common non-functional metrics and their meaning:

- __Reliability:__ Reliability is the measure of the software's ability to perform its intended function without failure or error. Common reliability metrics include mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), and mean time to repair (MTTR).

- __Maintainability:__ Maintainability is the measure of the software's ability to be modified or repaired with ease. Common maintainability metrics include code readability, code complexity, and code maintainability index.

- __Efficiency:__ Efficiency is the measure of the software's ability to perform its intended function within a given resource budget. Common efficiency metrics include execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.

- __Usability:__ Usability is the measure of the software's ability to be used effectively and efficiently by its intended users. Common usability metrics include user satisfaction, task completion time, and error rate.

- __Portability:__ Portability is the measure of the software's ability to run on different hardware and software environments without modification. Common portability metrics include platform support, cross-platform compatibility, and adherence to industry standards.

Overall, non-functional software metrics provide valuable insights into the quality and performance of a software system beyond just its functional capabilities.
